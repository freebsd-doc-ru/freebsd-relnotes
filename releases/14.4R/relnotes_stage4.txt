Subject: zfs: emit .note.GNU-stack section for all ELF targets
Review: The commit fixes a linker warning when building the ZFS kernel module with binutils ld 2.44 by ensuring .note.GNU-stack sections are emitted for all ELF targets, preventing a deprecated warning about an executable stack.
Body:

  On FreeBSD, linking the zfs kernel module with binutils ld 2.44 shows
  the following warning:

      ld: warning: aesni-gcm-avx2-vaes.o: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack
      ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker

  Some of the `.S` files under `module/icp/asm-x86_64/modes` check whether
  to emit the `.note.GNU-stack` section using:

      #if defined(__linux__) && defined(__ELF__)

  We could add `&& defined(__FreeBSD__)` to the test, but since all other
  `.S` files in the OpenZFS tree use:

      #ifdef __ELF__

  it would seem more logical to use that instead. Any recent ELF platform
  should support these note sections by now.

Subject: libc++: avoid use of deprecated builtin
Review: The libc++ library now uses is_trivially_copyable instead of the deprecated __is_trivially_relocatable builtin, fixing build issues with recent clang versions.
Body:

  This pulls in LLVM commit accfbd4cb327411ad66c0109ba1841482b871967 to
  avoid the use of __libcpp_is_trivially_relocatable.
  This fixes building FreeBSD libc++ with clang HEAD as of today.

  Original commit message:
  [libc++] Replace __is_trivially_relocatable by is_trivially_copyable (#124970)

  The __is_trivially_relocatable builtin has semantics that do not
  correspond to any current or future notion of trivial relocation.
  Furthermore, it currently leads to incorrect optimizations for some
  types on supported compilers:
  - Clang on Windows where types with non-trivial destructors get
    incorrectly optimized
  - AppleClang where types with non-trivial move constructors get
    incorrectly optimized

  Until there is an agreed upon and bugfree implementation of what it
  means to be trivially relocatable, it is safer to simply use trivially
  copyable instead. This doesn't leave a lot of types behind and is
  definitely correct.

  Add __deprecated decorator. This is for a deprecated interface. copystr

  LinuxKPI was defining this away completely in compiler.h. Since this is

  use the FreeBSD sys/cdefs.h version, otherwise define it away. For

Subject: heimdal-kadmin: Add support for the -f dump option
Review: The man:kadmin[8] utility gains a new -f option for dumping Heimdal KDC databases in MIT-compatible format, enabling migration to MIT KDC without recreating the database from scratch.
Body:

  The "-f" dump option allows a dump of the Heimdal
  KDC in a format that the MIT kdb5_util command can
  load into a MIT KDC's database.
  This makes transitioning from the Heimdal KDC to
  the current MIT one feasible without having to
  re-create the KDC database from scratch.

  glebius@ did the initial work, cherry picking these
  commits from the Heimdal sources on github and then doing
  extensive merge conflict resolution and other fixes so
  that it would build.
  Heimdal commit fca5399 authored by Nico Williams:
  Initial commit for second approach for multiple kvno.  NOT TESTED!

  Heimdal commit 57f1545 authored by Nico Williams:
  Add support for writing to KDB and dumping HDB to MIT KDB dump format
      Before this change Heimdal could read KDBs.  Now it can write to
      them too.

      Heimdal can now also dump HDBs (including KDBs) in MIT format,
      which can then be imported with kdb5_util load.

      This is intended to help in migrations from MIT to Heimdal by
      allowing migrations from Heimdal to MIT so that it is possible
      to rollback from Heimdal to MIT should there be any issues.  The
      idea is to allow a) running Heimdal kdc/kadmind with a KDB, or
      b) running Heimdal with an HDB converted from a KDB and then
      rollback by dumping the HDB and loading a KDB.

      Note that not all TL data types are supported, only two: last
      password change and modify-by.  This is the minimum necessary.
      PKINIT users may need to add support for KRB5_TL_USER_CERTIFICATE,
      and for databases with K/M history we may need to add KRB5_TL_MKVNO
      support.

  This resulted in a Heimdal kadmin that would dump
  the KDC database in MIT format.  However, there
  were issues when this dump was loaded into the
  current MIT KDC in FreeBSD current/15.0.

  The changes I did to make the dump more useful are listed below:
  When "-f MIT" is used for "kadmin -l dump" it writes
  the dump out in MIT format.  This dump format is understood
  by the MIT kdb5_util command.  The patch modifies the above
  so that the MIT KDC's master key keytab file can be provided
  as the argument to "-f" so that the principals are re-encrypted in
  it. This allows any principal with at least one strong encryption
  type key to work without needing a change_password.
  The strong encryption types supported by the Heimdal KDC are:
  aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
  aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96

  The issues my changes address are:
  - If there are weak encryption keys in a principal's entry,
    MIT's kadmin.local will report that the principcal's entry
    is incomplete or corrupted.
  - The keys are encrypted in Heimdal's master key.  The
    "-d" option can be used on the "kadmin -l dump" to
    de-encrypt them, but the passwords will not work on the
    current MIT KDC.

  To try and deal with the above issues, this patch modied the above to:
  - Does not dump the weak keys.
  - Re-encrypts the strong keys in MIT's master key if the argument
    to "-f" is actually a filename which holds the MIT KDC's
    master key keytab and not "MIT".
  - For principals that only have weak keys, it generates
    a fake strong key. This key will not work on the MIT
    KDC, but the principal entry will work once a
    change_password is done to it.
  - It always generates a "modified_by" entry, faking one if
    not already present in the Heimdal KDC database.
    This was necessary, since the MIT kadmin will
    report that the principal entry is "incomplete or
    corrupted" without one.

  It also fixed a problem where "get principal" no longer
  worked after the initial patch was applied.

  A man page update will be done as a separate commit.

  I believe this commit is acceptable since the Heimdal
  sources are now essentially deprecated in favor of the
  MIT sources and that this new "-f" patch simplifies
  the transition to the MIT KDC.

Body:

  Previously, the macros used '>' instead of '>=' when comparing elapsed
  time against the preferred and valid lifetimes. This caused any deprecated
  address to become usable again for one extra second after receiving each
  Router Advertisement. In that short window, the address could be
  selected as a source for outgoing connections.

  Update the checks to use '>=' so that addresses are deprecated or

Body:

  If this tunable is enabled and vtnet receives a packet with
  VIRTIO_NET_HDR_F_NEEDS_CSUM set, vtnet computes the TCP/UDP checksum
  and writes it in the checksum field.
  This was somewhat useful when vtnet pretended that such a packet has
  a correct checksum and set the mbuf flag CSUM_DATA_VALID.
  But this is not the case anymore.

  RIP has been obsolete for over 20 years and no one is running it on

Subject: manuals: Align our tree with upstream C23 macro
Review: The -isoC-2024 macro is deprecated and replaced by -isoC-2023 for C23 alignment, maintaining backward compatibility.
Body:

  Switch all instances of the -isoC-2024 macro to -isoC-2023 selected by
  upstream. Keep -isoC-2024 defined, but deprecated, for backwards compat.

Subject: net80211: fix VHT160 and VHT80P80 selection and enable in LinuxKPI 802.11
Review: The net80211 subsystem has been updated to properly support VHT160 and VHT80P80 channel widths with modern access points, aligning with changes from 802.11ac-2013 to 802.11-2020. This enables VHT160 and VHT80P80 in the LinuxKPI 802.11 driver compatibility code, affecting wireless performance and compatibility.
Body:

  Between 802.11ac-2013 and 802.11-2020 some fields were deprecated and the
  way VHT160 and VHT80P80 are selected has changed.
  In order to get onto VHT160 with modern APs adopt and support both the
  deprecated as well as the new logic.

  For simplicity of blocks we pull out the non-HT40 handling early on,
  followed by the "use HT", followed by the deprectaed options and then
  the 80Mhz channel width.

  In all cases keep checking (a) what is locally supported, (b) what the
  user has locally allowed (FVHT flags, [-]vht160 [-]vht80p80 [-]vht80
  [-]vht40), as well as (c) what is announced.  Provide possible fallbacks
  to lower channel widths in all cases (but VHT20, which means VHT is
  disabled).

  With this enable VHT160 and VHT80P80 in the LinuxKPI 802.11 driver
  compat code as well.

Subject: sound: Deprecate the MIDI sequencer
Review: The in-kernel MIDI sequencer is deprecated. This change adds a deprecation notice to the kernel and may affect applications that rely on this legacy interface.
Body:

  The in-kernel MIDI sequencer is not used anymore, since this is done by
  userland applications nowadays. It also contains bugs, and we are not
  exactly sure how it works, or if it worked properly in the first place.

Subject: sctp: fix mapping of interface address flags
Review: The SCTP address mapping logic is corrected to preserve the SCTP_ADDR_IFA_UNUSEABLE flag for deprecated addresses and to avoid marking tentative addresses as unusable. This improves SCTP connectivity in scenarios involving deprecated or tentative addresses.
Body:

  Do not clear the SCTP_ADDR_IFA_UNUSEABLE flag, if it was set due
  to the address being deprecated. Also don't declare tentative
  addresses as unusable.
  While there, cleanup the code.
