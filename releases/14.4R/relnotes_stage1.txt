Subject: kern: disallow user scheduling/debugging/signalling of jailed procs
Body:
  
  Currently, jails are generally ignored when determining whether the
  current process/thread can take action upon another, except to determine
  if the target's jail is somewhere in the source's hierarchy. Notably,
  uid 1001 in a jail (including prison0) can take action upon a process
  run by uid 1001 inside of a subordinate jail by default.
  
  While this could be considered a feature at times, it is a scenario
  that really should be deliberately crafted; there is no guarantee that
  uid 1001 in the parent jail is at all related to uid 1001 in a
  subordinate.
  
  This changes introduces three new privileges that grant a process
  this kind of insight into other jails:
  
  - PRIV_DEBUG_DIFFJAIL
  - PRIV_SCHED_DIFFJAIl
  - PRIV_SIGNAL_DIFFJAIL
  
  These can be granted independently or in conjunction with the
  accompanying *_DIFFCRED privileges, i.e.:
  
  - PRIV_DEBUG_DIFFCRED alone will let uid 1001 debug uid 1002, but
    PRIV_DEBUG_DIFFJAIL is additionally needed to let it debug uid 1002
    in a jail.
  
  - PRIV_DEBUG_DIFFJAIL alone will let uid 1001 debug uid 1001 in a jail,
    but will not allow it to debug uid 1002 in a jail.
  
  Note that security.bsd.see_jail_proc can be used for similar effects,
  but does not prevent a user from learning the pid of a jailed process
  with matching creds and signalling it or rescheduling it (e.g., cpuset).
  Debugging is restricted by visibility in all cases, so that one is less
  of a concern.
  
  This change adds a new jail(8) parameter for the parent to indicate on
  a per-jail basis if its users are open to being tampered with by the
  parent's unprivileged users: allow.unprivileged_parent_tampering.  This
  is enabled by default in 14.x, but may be disabled to honor the new
  priv(9) checks for earlier testing of the new behavior in FreeBSD 15.x.
  
  Development setups that involve regularly debugging jailed processes
  from outside the jail, will want to consider adding a default
  `allow.unprivileged_parent_tampering;` to your /etc/jail.conf before
  transitioning to 15.x.

Subject: powerpc: put the isync inside the TD_LOCK() checking loop
Body:
  
  Fix a narrow window where the lock is unlocked but the checking CPU
  hasn't flushed things appropriately.
  
  Inside this window the CPU inside cpu_switch() will loop forever thinking
  the destination thread is still blocked/locked even though it is not.
  
  This manifests as the system hanging after starting all APs.
  
  I've seen this reliably trigger in qemu-system-ppc64 running power9 pseries
  guests; the more CPUs the more likely it triggers at boot.

Subject: mdo(1): Add support and shortcuts for fully specifying users and groups
Body:
  
  While preserving compatibility ('root' implied if no user is specified,
  option '-i' not setting groups), introduce options to control finely
  which user and group IDs are set in the launched process.
  
  To minimize the risks of user error, mdo(1) by default enforces that all
  user and group IDs are specified, either with explicit values from the
  command-line or, if a known user name is passed with '-u', from the
  corresponding content of the password and group databases.  The other
  main type of use cases is to start from the current process'
  credentials, only amending part of them.  It is now also possible to
  blend both approaches, where some parts must be specified and the others
  can just be amended or left as is.
  
  Options:
  
  * As before:
  -u: Specifies a user name or ID to change all user IDs to.  If a known
      name is passed, also automatically sets all groups as per the
      password and group databases.
  -i: Starts from the current groups, instead of having to specify them
      by using '-u' with a known user name or explicitly.
  
  * New:
  -k: Starts from the current users (incompatible with '-u').  Implies '-i'.
  -g: Sets/overrides the primary group IDs with the passed group name or ID.
  -G: Sets/overrides the supplementary groups set with the passed list of
      comma-separated names or IDs.
  -s: Amend the supplementary groups set according to the list of
      comma-separated directives from the following:
      - @: Empties the set.  Must be the first directive.  Incompatible with '-G'.
      - +<group>: Add a group to the set.
      - -<group>: Remove a group from the set.  Takes precedence over +<group>.
  --euid: Overrides the effective user ID.
  --ruid: Overrides the real user ID.
  --svuid: Overrides the saved user ID.
  --egid: Overrides the effective group ID.
  --rgid: Overrides the real group ID.
  --svgid: Overrides the saved group ID.
  
  Option '-k' was introduced as a requirement to be explicit when one
  wants to keep the current user(s) instead of specifying new ones.  This
  is both for the purpose of avoiding foot-shooting and preserving the
  possibility to omit '-u' to switch to 'root'.  In order to avoid
  confusion, if any user or group overrides are specified, mdo(1) however
  enforces that either '-u' or '-k' has been specified (so, in practice,
  '-u root' is implied only in the absence of any other options except
  '-i').
  
  Some base supplementary groups set is needed when '-s' is used without
  directive '@'.  It can be an explicit one specified with '-G',
  effectively meaning that '-G' is processed before '-s'.  Else, it is
  determined from the password/group database (see initgroups(3)) if '-u'
  with a user name was passed, or is simply the current set if '-i' (or
  '-k') was specified.  Other cases require specifying the full set (using
  '-G' or '-s' with '@'), and will fail otherwise.
  
  As the release process for 15.0 is progressing, this is committed in
  advance of the still-in-progress tests and manual page updates.
  
  Note for MFC to stable/14: As initgroups() has its old behavior,
  consistently with it, remove the effective GID from being passed also as
  a supplementary group.

   * More punctuation
   * Just enough Katakana to say コンニチハ
   * Powerline glyphs in the Private Use Area at U+e0a0
  
  I have tried hard to keep the look of the font for Greek and Cyrillic
  glyphs, but not for symbols like arrows and mathematical operators where
  it makes no sense. Please let me know where I messed up (I can only
  barely read and write Greek, and hardly any Cyrillic and no Japanese at
  all). I used the documents of The Unicode Standard, Version 16.0 as
  guidance.
  
  But since Unicode is huuuuge, even just the BMP, there's more to
  come in the future, I hope.

Subject: jail: Add meta and env parameters
Body:
  
  Each one is an arbitrary string associated with a jail. It can be set
  upon jail creation or added/modified later:
  
      > jail -cm ... meta="tag1=value1 tag2=value2" env="configuration"
  
  The values are not inherited from the parent jail.
  
  A parent jail can read both metadata parameters, while a child jail can
  read only env via security.jail.env sysctl.
  
  The maximum size of meta or env per jail is controlled by the
  global security.jail.meta_maxbufsize sysctl. Decreasing it does not
  alter the existing meta information.
  
  Each metadata buffer can be handled as a set of key=value\n strings:
  
      > jail -cm ... meta="$(echo k1=v1; echo k2=v2)" env.1=one
      > jls meta.k2 env.1 meta.k1
  
  While meta.k1= resets the value to an empty string, the meta.k1 without
  the equal sign removes the given key.

Subject: pkg: clarify argument parsing
Body:
  
  Currently pkg parses all arguments and subcommands in a single
  getopt_long() loop. This results in quite a bit of accidental
  complexity, especially around the -r option for the bootstrap and add
  subcommands.
  
  This also results in the undocumented behavior of all options understood
  by pkg(7) being accepted anywhere in the argument list regardless of
  their position. This contradicts the behavior of pkg(8) and I find it
  quite unexpected.
  
  This patch splits the argument parsing done by pkg(7) into two phases
  for global options and subcommand options. This gives behavior that
  matches pkg(8), accepting the subset of pkg(8) options supported by
  pkg(7) in the exact same positions that pkg(8) accepts them.
  
  This is however a somewhat breaking change, as options are no longer
  accepted by pkg(7) in places they are rejected by pkg(8). For example,
  `pkg -f bootstrap` no longer works, only `pkg bootstrap -f`.
  
  The original motivation for writing this patch was investigating support
  for --rootdir in pkg(7). Since pkg(8) uses -r as the short form for
  both --rootdir and --repository depending on the position, I decided
  that pkg(7) needed to be brought inline with pkg(8)'s argument parsing
  behavior to avoid confusion.
  
  This patch also gets rid of args_add_message (unused since 40b9f924b1)

  pkg: suppress error on unknown options
  
  pkg(7) does not understand all the options that pkg(8) understands and
  should never log errors about unknown options that it will pass on to
  pkg(8) without touching.

Subject: deprecate RIP
Body:
  
  Per https://wiki.freebsd.org/DeprecationPlan, deprecate RIP in 15.0R,
  with the intention of removing it in 16.0R.
  
  Add a note to the manpages of routed(8), rdisc(8), rtquery(8),
  route6d(8) and rip6query(8) noting that they will be removed
  in a future release.
  
  RIP has been obsolete for over 20 years and no one is running it on
  modern networks.  If someone really needs RIP, there are alternatives
  such as 'bird' or 'quagga' available from ports; there is no need to
  ship it in base.

Subject: swapon: parse md.eli device for encrypted swapfile from fstab
Body:
  
  Summary:
  Although fstab(5) suggests usage of md(4) and an .eli suffix in the same
  paragraph, the combination did not work.
  This patch adds a bit of parsing, creates the md device and then passes
  that device to the *_geli function.
  
  Add unit tests.

Subject: libpam: Additional module directory.
Body:
  
  Many if not most ports that install PAM modules install them into
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/security instead of just ${LOCALBASE}/lib, because
  all the world is Linux.  Rather than try to fix the ports, add that
  directory to the search path.
